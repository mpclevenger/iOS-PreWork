# Background Color Changing App
This application changes the background color of the app whenever the button is pressed.
<br>
##**How It's Made: **<br>
Tech Used: Swift<br>
<br>
Following the instructions in the CodePath pre-work module I connected the UI to the logic and coded functionality to randomly generate RGB colors. 
<br>
##**Lessons Learned:**<br>
This was my first experience using Swift language. I loved the fact you can drag and drop the UI elements to the ViewController code to link it.
<br>
##**Enhancement Ideas:**<br>

    1. Add logic to change the font to a lighter or darker color depending upon the background color.<br>
    
    2. Randomize the font size.<br>
    
    3. Randomize the font location.<br>
<br>

    App Idea: Modern Misery Index<br>
        The app is designed to help users track their mood and connect with others who share similar emotional states. Inspired by the concept of the misery index, this app proves a plaform for people to log and monitor their moods over time, fostering a sense of community and shared expereince. The application will offer a way to discover and engage with local activities, allowing users to explore events and share their reactions. <br>
        Key Features:<br>
            1. Anonyminity and privacy<br>
                - Users do not need to reveal their true identity. This will hopefully encourage the members to be honest about their feelings. Additionally, users will be able to restrict who can see their mood log and activity.<br>
                
            2. Mood Tracking and Logging<br>

            3. Activity Discovery and Sharing<br>
                - Finding activities coming up in your local area can be difficult. The app will offer the ability for users to post upcoming events. Other users can post their thoughts on the event. This can also be used to facilitate making new friends.
