This application changes the background color of the app whenever the button is pressed.
<br>
<br>

How It's Made: <br>
Tech Used: Swift<br>
<br>
Following the instructions in the CodePath pre-work module I connected the UI to the logic and coded functionality to randomly generate RGB colors. 
<br>
<br>
**Lessons Learned:**<br>
This was my first experience using Swift language. I loved the fact you can drag and drop the UI elements to the ViewController code to link it.
<br>
<br>
**Enhancement Ideas:**<br>

    1. Add logic to change the font to a lighter or darker color depending upon the background color.<br>
    
    2. Randomize the font size.<br>
    
    3. Randomize the font location.<br>
